# YouTube Clone Project 🎥

This is a **YouTube Clone** project I built as a personal practice after learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I originally followed a 3-year-old tutorial for the HTML/CSS basics, and then expanded it by applying what I learned in JavaScript to make it more modern and interactive.

## 🚀 Features
- 📺 **Main YouTube-like page** with sidebar, header, and video grid.  
- 🎨 **Modular CSS files**:
  - `general.css` – global styling  
  - `header.css` – YouTube-style top bar  
  - `sidebar.css` – collapsible sidebar navigation  
  - `video.css` – video grid and thumbnails  
- ⚡ **Basic JavaScript functionality**:
  - Example: dynamic video rendering (used sample videos of *Run*)  
  - Responsive UI behavior with JavaScript

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling (with modular CSS files for organization)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – interactivity  

---

## 🌟 Motivation
I wanted to apply my **front-end development learning journey**:
- Practicing **HTML & CSS** from the tutorial.  
- Upgrading it with my **own JavaScript logic**.  
- Trying to make a simplified version of the **current YouTube UI**.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- This is **not a full YouTube clone** — it’s just the main page layout with some basic features.  
- More features (like search, video player, comments, etc.) could be added in the future.
